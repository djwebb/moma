# moma
Moma ocean model and associated programs.

Moma version 1.17 is the last of the known IOS versions of the single processor code.  The IOS group then used it to develop a multi-processor code using PVM message passing (moma.pvm).  Later PVM was replaced by MPI in the moma.mpi version and finally in occam.
